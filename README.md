Transliteration for uploading files (MODx Evo)

I'm still looking for a solution for nicely transliterated umlauts for the MODx mcpuk uploader.php. 
With my (not nice) hack applied I'm getting close, but the result is still not as expected. It seems some encoding  take place befor the transalias-plugin could manage the transliterationâ€¦ 

I'm looking forward to some suggestions.
